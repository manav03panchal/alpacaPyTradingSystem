# alpacaPyTradingSystem

An attempt at making a standalone paper trading GUI using pyQt6 and the Alpcaca-py SDK.

# To run this project

Get keys from Alpaca.com, make a file called "keys.py" and open gui.py and run.
Internet connection is required.

# Current Issues

The live quote/asset-price function works, but implementing charting functionality as well as an order placement utility seems cumbersome
and frankly speaking, almost impossible with the resources at hand.

# Future Work

Will migrate the logic into making a web-app using a different language and tech stack
